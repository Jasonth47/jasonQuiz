I made a Quiz in React!

To run my app you just need to run ### `npm -install` and then ### `npm start`
I am running node version 18.13.0

As for my project features:

1.Use arrays, objects, sets or
maps to store and retrieve
information that is displayed
in your app.

2.Analyze data that is stored in
arrays, objects, sets or maps
and display information about
it in your app.

I used an arry of questions to store a score and display a specific p tag based on the total score.
I stored a user input string to also display in that p tag.
I also used components to make sure a button was pressed before being able to hit next in the array.

3.Retrieve data from a
third-party API and use it to
display something within your
app.

I used a free BORED api and displyed a type specific  activity in the p tag at the end of the quiz if you scored high enough.

4.Develop your project using a
common JavaScript
framework such as React

I developed this project in the React framework. it was a challenge but learning about how useful using useState and useEffect are along with props to change the state i can see how this framework could be useful in future projects.
